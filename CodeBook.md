# Code Book: UCI Human Activity Recognition Data Set

This data archive for this analysis was first downloaded by this author  on 10/31/16, but it is also downloaded from a Cloudfront server [(here)] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), by the script `run_analysis.R` in this repo. This data was originally obtained from a UCI Website [(here)] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 

The results produced by the analysis script are written to disk as two data files:
 1. `tidy_data.txt`, which contains selected data from the original UCI analysis itself, in space delimited format
 2. `tidy_summary.txt`, which contains summary metrics of the feature data from UCI, calculated by `run_analysis.R`

To produce the dataset from which (1) was selected, investigators used Samsung cell phones to record gyroscopic and accelerometer sensor readings of 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.  The cell phones were worn on the belts of 30 subjects while they engaged in six, video-recorded acitvities (see list below). From the sensor readings, 561 different features were calculated, of which 66 were selected for this analysis. Each observation of 66 features corresponds to a row in (1), calculated based on 128 readings taken during a 2.56 sec time window.  The 66 features selected for this analysis correspond to signal means and standard deviations: original feature names containing `mean()` or `std()`. Features not selected for this analysis include `max()`, `min()`, `correlation()`, and a diverse set of other caclulated variables.

Each row of feature values in (1), and in the full dataset in the file `features.txt` of the UCI archive, was calculated based on readings taken while a specific `subject` engaged in a specific `activity`. Column 1, numbered 1 to 30, contains the subject ID number, and is encoded as a factor variable in the loaded dataframes. Each row of column 2 takes on one of the six values below, and is also encoded as a factor variable. The values below are transformed from those in the original dataset by lower-casing and substitution of a "." for hyphens between words.

Columns 3 through 68 of the files contain the original feature data (file 1) and summary metrics (file 2). In the data of file (1), all features were normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. This data consists of 10,299 rows, each corresponding to data collection over a specific 2.56 sec window for a specific subject-activity pair. The summary metrics in file (2) are averages across all time windows (rows of 1) associated with a given subject-activity pair, resulting in just 180 rows (`6 activities * 30 subjects`). 

The names of the variables selected for the dataset in (1) are listed below alongside their column number in files (1) and (2). Note that `t` is used to denote time domain, and `f` is used to denote frequency domain; `acc`, `gyro` stand for acceleration and gyroscope. The terms `body` and `gravity` refer to a separation of acceleration into body and gravity components. The magnitudes `mag` are calculated as Euclidean norms of specific signals by taking into account variation over all three axial directions `x`, `y`, and `z`. The term `jerk` refers to derived signals over time of body linear acceleration and angular velocity. For more detail on the pre-processing of raw sensor readings (summarized here), see the files `features_info.txt` and `README.txt`, both included in the UCI archive for the experiment. 

The variable names shown here are transformed for readability from those used in `features.txt` in the original data archive. All letters were lower-cased; all non-alphanumerics, white-space, and variable numbers were removed; and a dot (".") was placed between each pair of word fragments.  For the averages in file (2), the variable names below are prefixed with the characters `avg.`
